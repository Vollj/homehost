# Setup

Run `npm install` under the client and server directories  
In `./config.yml`, set the media paths, and specify a working API key for TMDb API and Spotify Web API  
```yaml
# Server-side configs
movies:
  path  : '/path/to/movies/directory'
  api   : 'api.themoviedb.org/3'
  key   : '<api_key>'
music:
  path  : '/path/to/music/directory'
  api   : 'api.spotify.com/v1'
  key   : '<access_token>'
tv:
  path  : '/path/to/tv/directory'
  api   : 'api.themoviedb.org/3'
  key   : '<api_key>'
```
If you dont have keys, you can request API authorization from Spotify at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/, and TMDb at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction  

## Naming conventions

Your media must appear in the path set by `config.yml`  
üé• **Movies**  
```
<movies_path>  
 - (subdirectory)?  
   - (movie_file_name <TMDb-movie-ID>) (.mp4|.mkv)
```
üéµ **Music**  
```
<music_path>  
 - (album_directory_name <Spotify-album-ID>)  
   - ((<disc_number>-)?<track_number> track_file_name) (.mp3)
```
Tracks not found on Spotify can be put in a directory titled `Unknown Album` sans disc/ track number
```
<music_path>  
 - Unknown Album  
   - (track_file_name) (.mp3)
```
üì∫ **TV**  
```
<tv_path>  
 - (tv_show_directory_name <TMDb-tv-ID>)  
   - (S<season_number>E<episode_number> episode_file_name) (.mp4|.mkv)
```
## Generating metadata

Server requires `<media>.json` file data at startup. Initial json state should be empty
```json
./movies.json, ./music.json, ./tv.json
{
  "movies": [], "music": [], "tv": []
}
```
From the base directory, run `yarn homehost` to start homehost at `http://localhost:5000/`  
On the server, call `/api/generate` **once**. Wait for the async call to finish and save  
There is no 'watch' or 'hot reload' feature for server media. Adding or changing media files requires a json reset and rerunning `/api/generate`
By default, `5000` is the node server port, `3000` is the react client port  
**NOTE:** `nodemon` will restart to file changes and interrupt async. Use `node server` instead for generating metadata
